## Project Stack

This project is strongly front-end focused, it was written mainly in Vanilla Javascript, with heavy usage of HTML and CSS, and just a hint of JQuery. My main goal here was to learn more about front-end development in plain Javascript, to use a freely accessible API, and to use my design-oriented side to create a really eye-catching site. 
It also has a little back-end written in Java, with the usage of Jetty, the only thing the back-end currently does is rendering the main page ("/"); I decided to keep the back-end in case I would like to expand the website with more fearues, where the backend would come in handy.

## Project Status

I have a lot of future plans with this project. First of all, since the deployment of this project, I have started to learn to code in C#, I studied the whole .NET ecosystem, and I have participated in web projects using ASP.NET Core for backend develpoment. Thus I certainly want to change the Java backend to C# and to use ASP.NET Core. I have a different path for this project too: to leave the backend completely, make it entirely front-end based, and as I want to learn Angular and Typescript now, I aim to use this project as a learning material for those.
